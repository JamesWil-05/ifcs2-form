Formative for IFCS2 
---

For your summative assignments, you will be tasked with developing a Minimum
Viable Product (MVP) for a GUI application in Python. To prepare for this task,
create a basic Python GUI application; for instance, a game that asks for users' names and poses mathematics questions, subsequently recording the scores
and the names in a CSV file. The subject of your app is discretionary, but it
should demonstrate your comprehension of the following:

1. modular design, exemplified by the utilisation of concise, reusable and
testable functions

2. understanding of sound coding practices and adherence to [PEP8
standards](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

3. permanent storage - reading and writing to a CSV file.
